I'm JL.
I'm a mechanical engineer which I majored of course.
But I also like programming although I suck.

Because with programming, I believe I can improve working efficiency with automation - such as result analyzing, etc.

Unfortunately, I've been doing this (Python) at night before sleeping because I've been busy.
Especially now, too. I probably end up finishing this in a nicer way, but right now, this is the best.
Ciao.
